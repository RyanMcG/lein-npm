# lein-npm

Leiningen plugin for enabling Node based ClojureScript projects.

## Installation

To enable lein-npm for your project, put the following in the
`:plugins` vector of your `project.clj` file:

![Latest version](https://clojars.org/lein-npm/latest-version.svg)

## Managing NPM dependencies

You can specify a project's NPM dependencies by adding a
`:node-dependencies` key in your `project.clj`:

```clojure
:node-dependencies [[underscore "1.4.3"]
                    [nyancat "0.0.3"]
                    [mongodb "1.2.7"]]
```

These dependencies, and any `:node-dependencies` of packages pulled in
through the regular `:dependencies`, will be installed through NPM
when you run either `lein npm install` or `lein deps`.

## Invoking NPM

You can execute NPM commands that require the presence of a
`package.json` file using the `lein npm` command. This command creates
a temporary `package.json` based on your `project.clj` before invoking
the NPM command you specify. The keys `name`, `description`, `version` and
`dependencies` are automatically added to `package.json`. Other keys can be
specified by adding a `:nodejs` key in your `project.clj`:

```clojure
  :nodejs {:scripts {:test "testem"}}
```

```sh
$ lein npm install        # installs project dependencies
$ lein npm ls             # lists installed dependencies
$ lein npm search nyancat # searches for packages containing "nyancat"
```

## Bower dependencies

[lein-bower](https://github.com/chlorinejs/lein-bower) is a related
Leiningen plugin that performs the same service for
[Bower](https://github.com/twitter/bower) dependencies. lein-bower
itself depends on lein-npm.

## Running ClojureScript apps

The plugin installs a `lein run` hook which enables you to specify a
JavaScript file instead of a Clojure namespace for the `:main` key in
your `project.clj`, like this:

```clojure
:main "js/main.js"
```

If `:main` is a string that refers to a file that exists and ends with
`.js`, it will launch this file using Node, after first running `npm
install` if necessary. Any command line arguments following `lein run`
will be passed through to the Node process.

## Changing the directory used

npm does not allow you to put stuff anywhere besides `node_modules`, even
if that name is [against your religion](https://www.npmjs.org/doc/faq.html),
however, you can change the root used by lein-npm to be something other than
your project root like this:

```clojure
:npm-root "resources/public/js"
```

Or you can use a keyword to look the path up in your project map:

```clojure
:npm-root :target-path
```
